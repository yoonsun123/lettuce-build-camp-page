🎨 Scratch Camp: Thanksgiving Feast Creator
Ages 8-14 | Beginner Friendly | Nov 24-28
What Your Child Will Create: Over four fun-filled days, students will design their own unique animal character and a signature Thanksgiving dish using Scratch's intuitive block-based coding platform. On the first two days, they'll bring their creations to life with animations, sounds, and personality. During days three and four, the magic happens—all students' characters and dishes come together in one collaborative feast scene where animals gather around the table, present their dishes, and share what they're grateful for. The final project becomes a heartwarming digital celebration that students can proudly share with family and friends.
Skills & Benefits: This camp introduces fundamental coding concepts like sequencing, loops, and events through creative storytelling. Students develop problem-solving skills, digital literacy, and collaborative teamwork while building confidence in their ability to code. No prior experience is needed—just creativity and enthusiasm! By the end, your child will have a portfolio-ready animation project and a solid foundation in block-based programming that prepares them for more advanced coding adventures.
What Parents Should Know:
Schedule: 4 sessions (Nov 24, 25, 26, 28), 1.5 hours each
Requirements: Laptop with internet access, no prior coding experience needed
Class Size: Small groups for personalized attention
Takeaway: Animated Scratch project your child can play and share

🎮 Roblox Adventure Camp: Turkey's Thanksgiving Quest: 
Ages 10-16 | Roblox Builders | Nov 24-28
What Your Child Will Create: Students will dive into Roblox Studio to build their very own Thanksgiving-themed game challenge! Each participant chooses one exciting mission type: collecting feast ingredients through an obstacle course, gathering decorations in a treasure hunt, helping forest friends with delivery tasks, or creating an exploration maze to find the perfect party location. Over the first two days, students learn Roblox Studio basics and build their challenge environment with custom terrain, objects, and obstacles. Days three and four focus on adding interactive elements through simple scripting and then connecting everyone's challenges into one epic multiplayer turkey adventure game that the whole class can play together.
Skills & Benefits: Your child will learn 3D game design, basic Lua scripting, and creative problem-solving in one of the most popular game development platforms used by millions. This camp builds spatial reasoning, logical thinking, and teaches core programming concepts like variables, functions, and event handling—all while having a blast building games. Students leave with a complete, playable Roblox game they can share with friends, plus the skills to continue creating their own games independently. Perfect for Roblox fans ready to go from player to creator!
What Parents Should Know:
Schedule: 4 sessions (Nov 24, 25, 26, 28), 1.5 hours each
Requirements: Laptop, Roblox account (free), Roblox Studio installed
Prior Experience: Familiarity with playing Roblox helpful but not required
Takeaway: Published Roblox game your child can play with friends

💻 Code with AI: Thanksgiving Game Builder Workshop
Ages 10-18 | All Levels Welcome | Nov 26 & 28 (2 Days Only!)
What Your Child Will Create: This intensive 2-day workshop teaches students to harness the power of AI coding assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot) to build professional-quality web games far beyond what beginners could typically create. Working as a collaborative team, students will build either a mysterious Thanksgiving Escape Room where players solve puzzles to escape Grandma's house before dinner gets cold, or a fast-paced Turkey Run racing game with obstacles and power-ups. Each student builds an individual component (a puzzle room, an obstacle course, the character creator, etc.) using AI to help write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. On day two, everything comes together into one polished, playable game that students can share and be proud of.
Skills & Benefits: Your child will learn the cutting-edge skill of AI-assisted development—how to effectively prompt AI tools, understand and modify generated code, and debug when things don't work perfectly. This is the future of coding: using AI as a powerful collaborator while still maintaining creative control and technical understanding. Students gain real web development experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learn to break down complex projects into manageable pieces, and discover that coding doesn't have to be intimidating. This workshop welcomes all experience levels because AI helps level the playing field—beginners can accomplish impressive projects while advanced students can dive deeper into customization.
What Parents Should Know:
Schedule: 2 sessions ONLY (Nov 26 & 28), 2 hours each - perfect for busy schedules!
Requirements: Laptop with internet access, willingness to try new tools
Prior Experience: Basic coding familiarity helpful but not required (any language: Scratch, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
Takeaway: Web-based game + skills in using AI coding tools professionally

🤖 AI & Machine Learning camp: The Great Turkey's Escape
Ages 15-18 (Grades 10-12) | Advanced | Dates TBD
What Your Child Will Create: This advanced, college-prep level camp teaches students how artificial intelligence actually works by building real machine learning models from the ground up. Students will create an interactive "choose your own adventure" story game where a clever turkey tries to escape becoming Thanksgiving dinner—but here's the twist: machine learning algorithms power the game's intelligence. Working in specialized teams, students will collect training data, engineer features, and train classification models using Python and industry-standard libraries like scikit-learn. One team builds a player personality classifier that adapts the story to match play styles (brave, cautious, clever), another creates an escape route success predictor that calculates survival odds based on game conditions, and a third develops an ending predictor that routes players to satisfying conclusions. By the final day, all models integrate into one AI-powered game that makes intelligent decisions in real-time.
Skills & Benefits: Your child will gain genuine data science and machine learning experience that stands out on college applications and prepares them for STEM careers. They'll learn the complete ML workflow: data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training with Decision Trees and other algorithms, evaluation using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices, and real-world application integration. This isn't a superficial "intro to AI" course—students work with the same Python libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) used by professional data scientists and understand core concepts like supervised learning, overfitting, and classification. Perfect for motivated students considering computer science, data science, or AI engineering majors who want hands-on experience beyond what high school typically offers.
What Parents Should Know:
Schedule: 4 sessions (dates TBD), 1.5 hours each
STRICT Prerequisites Required:
✅ Completed Algebra 2 or higher (need to understand functions, graphs, statistics)
✅ Proficient in Python programming (6+ months minimum)
✅ Can write functions, loops, work with lists/dictionaries independently
Requirements: Laptop with Python installed (setup instructions provided before camp)
Takeaway: Working ML-powered game + portfolio-ready AI project + real data science skills
Note: Students may be screened for prerequisites to ensure camp success
